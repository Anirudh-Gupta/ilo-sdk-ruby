# Ruby SDK for HPE iLO
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ilo-sdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ilo-sdk)

TODO: Description

## Installation

- Require the gem in your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem 'ilo-sdk'
  ```

  Then run `$ bundle install`
- Or run the command:

  ```bash
  $ gem install ilo-sdk
  ```


## Client
Everything you do with this API happens through a client object. 
Creating the client object is the first step; then you can perform actions on the client.

```ruby 
require 'ilo-sdk'
client = OneviewSDK::Client.new(
  host: 'https://ilo.example.com',
  user: 'Administrator',              # This is the default
  password: 'secret123',
  ssl_enabled: true,                  # This is the default and strongly encouraged
  logger: Logger.new(STDOUT),         # This is the default
  log_level: :info,                   # This is the default
)
```

:lock: Tip: Check the file permissions because the password is stored in clear-text.

**Environment Variables**

TODO

### Custom logging
The default logger is a standard logger to STDOUT, but if you want to specify your own, you can.  However, your logger must implement the following methods:

```ruby
debug(String)
info(String)
warn(String)
error(String)
level=(Symbol, etc.) # The parameter here will be the log_level attribute
```


## Actions
Actions are performed on the client, and defined in the [helper modules](lib/ilo-sdk/helpers).

## Custom requests
In most cases, interacting with the client object is enough, but sometimes you need to make your own custom requests to the iLO.
This project makes it extremely easy to do with some built-in methods for the client object. Here are some examples:

```ruby
# Get a list of schemas:
response = client.rest_api(:get, '/rest/v1/Schemas')
# or even more simple:
response = client.rest_get('/rest/v1/Schemas')

# Then we can validate the response and convert the response body into a hash...
data = client.response_handler(response)
```

This example is about as basic as it gets, but you can make any type of iLO request.
If a resource does not do what you need, this will allow you to do it.
Please refer to the documentation and [code](lib/ilo-sdk/rest.rb) for complete list of methods and information about how to use them.
